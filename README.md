**Shiksha Copilot** is a transformative educational tool developed under the **VELLM (Universal Empowerment with Large Language Models)** initiative by Microsoft Research India. It is specifically designed to assist educators in streamlining and enriching the process of lesson planning and content creation. Shiksha Copilot acts as an intelligent assistant, empowering teachers to craft meaningful, engaging, and curriculum-aligned learning experiences tailored to the specific needs of their classrooms.

By allowing educators to select the exact curriculum, grade level, subject, and chapter they plan to teach, Shiksha Copilot provides a customized experience that aligns directly with their instructional goals. The system leverages advanced LLMs to generate a variety of pedagogically sound educational artifacts including:
- Detailed lesson plans
- Real-world examples that contextualize abstract concepts
- Analogies that bridge new ideas with familiar experiences
- Hands-on activities that promote experiential learning
- Formative and summative assessments for effective evaluation

Once teachers review and validate the generated content, the system automatically compiles it into user-friendly formats such as Microsoft Word (DOCX), PowerPoint (PPT), and student-friendly handouts. Furthermore, teachers can generate comprehensive question banks covering multiple chapters in alignment with standard educational blueprint formats. The system also features a conversational AI interface, enabling users to interact with Shiksha Copilot via natural language queries, ask textbook-related questions, or generate customized educational materials on the fly.

## Intended Use
- Empower educators across different regions and teaching contexts to create personalized, effective, and inclusive learning experiences.
- Accelerate the lesson planning workflow while maintaining high educational quality.
- Enhance the teacher’s role by freeing up time spent on content generation and enabling more focus on teaching delivery and student engagement.
- Provide researchers and developers access to modular and reusable components of the system to further innovation in education technology.

## Out-of-Scope Use
- Shiksha Copilot is **not intended** for commercial deployment or mission-critical applications without extensive validation.
- It should **not be used** in domains that require high-stakes decision-making such as healthcare, law enforcement, or finance, where inaccuracies can lead to serious consequences.
- It should also **not be applied** in any highly regulated environment unless the components have undergone necessary compliance checks and validations.
- The system is designed exclusively for teacher use with human oversight and is **not intended** for direct student interaction.

## Getting Started with Reusable Components
Shiksha Copilot has a modular design philosophy, allowing each of its core functionalities to be used independently based on specific user requirements:

[Ingestion Pipeline](components/ingestion-pipeline/README.md)

[LLM Queue](components/llm-queue/README.md) -- Deprecated

[RAG Wrapper](components/rag-wrapper/README.md)

[Translation Model Data Collection](components/translation/data_collection/README.md)

[Translation Model Training](components/translation/training/README.md)

[Translation Model Inference](components/translation/inference/README.md)

*Instructions for backend and frontend deployment of the entire Shiksha Copilot system, as well as individual modules, are provided in dedicated setup guides within the repository.*

## Evaluation
- We conducted extensive qualitative evaluations involving internal user testing teams and collaborated with educational partners such as the *Sikshana Foundation* to assess usability and utility in real-world classroom scenarios.
- The system integrates Azure Content Filtering services to moderate both user inputs and generated outputs, ensuring educational appropriateness, factual correctness, and respectful communication.
- Additionally, meta prompts are employed to guide the language model toward generating only education-relevant and unbiased content.
- Ongoing system performance is tracked via anonymous telemetry available to the developers of the application.

## Limitations
- **Experimental Nature:** Shiksha Copilot is a research prototype and has not been extensively tested for production use. All usage should be under human supervision.
- **Language Support:** Primarily tested on English-language inputs and outputs; support for other languages is experimental and should be used cautiously.
- **Model Limitations:** Outputs from large language models may occasionally include hallucinated facts, speculative content, or biased information. It is crucial that educators carefully review and validate the content before classroom use.
- **Content Accuracy:** The AI-generated content may contain occasional errors or inaccuracies. Users of Shiksha Copilot should thoroughly validate all content before incorporating it into their classroom teaching materials.
- **Model Dependency:** The quality and reliability of outputs are inherently tied to the underlying model. Shiksha Copilot currently utilizes the GPT-4o model.
- **Security:** Developers deploying the tool in open environments must implement/use appropriate security mechanisms like Azure's content moderation.

## Best Practices
- Choose model configurations that best suit your application's context—larger models for general-purpose generation or smaller fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks.
- Leverage platforms like **Azure OpenAI (AOAI)** that incorporate state-of-the-art safety features and Responsible AI (RAI) policies. Learn more from:

## Privacy & Ethics
Shiksha Copilot is developed with a strong commitment to privacy-by-design principles and ethical considerations in educational technology:

### Data Privacy
- All user interactions with Shiksha Copilot are treated with strict confidentiality and data minimization practices.
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored in the system, and none is required for any of its features to work.
- No educational content generated by AI or edited by teachers is stored in our systems.
- Anonymous telemetry collects only system performance metrics and does not track individual user behavior or content.

### Ethical AI Principles
- **Transparency**: We clearly communicate the capabilities and limitations of the system to users.
- **Fairness**: Content generation algorithms are regularly audited for potential biases across different cultural contexts, subjects, and pedagogical approaches.
- **Inclusivity**: The system is designed to support diverse learning needs and perspectives, with ongoing improvements to enhance accessibility.
- **Agency and Oversight**: Teachers maintain complete editorial control over generated content, reinforcing their critical role in educational decision-making.

### Educational Content Ethics
- Content is generated with age-appropriateness in mind from the beginning, rather than applying filtering post-generation. Users can implement their own additional filters if necessary.
- The system incorporates safeguards against generating harmful, misleading, or culturally insensitive content.

### Research Ethics
- Any research conducted using anonymized data follows established ethical guidelines for educational research.
- If deployed in research contexts, proper informed consent is obtained from all participants, with clear explanation of data usage.
- Research findings are transparently reported, including both positive outcomes and limitations.

### Governance
- An internal ethics review process evaluates potential applications and deployment contexts.
- Regular audits assess the system's adherence to these ethical principles and identify areas for improvement.
- We actively seek input from educational experts, ethicists, and stakeholders to continuously refine our approach.

By prioritizing these principles, we aim to ensure that Shiksha Copilot serves as a responsible tool that empowers educators while respecting their autonomy, protecting user privacy, and advancing equitable educational outcomes.
